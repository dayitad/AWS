## Serverless

+ Developers do not provision servers in these services, everything is managed. 
+ Amazon - S3 (users get static content from our S3 buckets delivered as a website)
+ AWS Cognito - It manages user login, users would have their identity stored here.
+ API gateway - It exposes REST API to be invoked
+ Lambda Functions - They store and retrieve data from Dynamo DB
+ DynamoDB
+ SNS and SQS
+ AWS Kinesis Data Firehose
+ Aurora Serverless
+ Step Functions
+ Fargate
