## AWS

#### EC2
Amazon EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud) is a webservice that provides resizable compute capacity in cloud. It reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing to quicly scale capacity both upwards and downwards based on changing computing requirements.

It has changed the economics of computing by allowing to pay for what is being used. It provides the tools needed to build a failure resistent application.

##### Types of Instances 
+ On Demand - allows to pay by the hour or second(Linux is by second and Windows is by hour)
+ Reserved - Reservation for 1 or 3 years, certain or entire amount upfront, but large discount compared to on demand price.
+ Spot - enables to bid a price for instance capacity, if application has flexible timings, this can lead to significant savings.
+ Dedicated host - These are physical ec2 server dedicated for use. They allow to bring exisitng server-bound software licenses over to aws and thus save costs.
