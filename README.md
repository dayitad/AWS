#### AWS BUDGET

Go to MyBilling Dashboard under Billing Service. 
Billing > Budget > Cost Budget > Set your Budget > Give a name to your budget and set period to monthly.
There we can set a fixed budget of 10$. If we do not want to spend anything, we will set 0.01$. AWS will send an email if any cost is incurred above our budget.

We can also configure alerts. 
Configure Alerts > Actual Costs > Alert Threshold (Percentage of Budgeted Amount) - Provide email id.

To find service charges for a month, we have to look under Billing > Bills > Find Month > Select Month > Service Charge
